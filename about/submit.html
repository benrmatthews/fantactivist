<h3>How do you get started?</h3>
<p>Just <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/montfort.io/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmLSF9un-r704IIjQeWP7VPg4pcdiPkWXdP5klxgYBQ7nAmg/viewform">fill out this form</a> for your cause or social movement, and I'll get back to you (over email) with a standard set of interview questions for you to answer. üëç</p>

<h3>Why share your story?</h3>
<p>Free traffic and marketing; useful for finding new supporters, partnerships, and feedback opportunities from the people who read your interview; a unique and cathartic chance to share your knowledge and experiences with the world; and the warm feeling that comes from knowing your story will help others like you.</p>
  
<h3>Who is eligible to be interviewed?</h3>
<p>Anyone who has started a cause or social movement that has generated some social impact. If your cause hasn't launched yet, or if it launched within the past couple of months, then it's probably too early for an interview. If in doubt, please get in touch anyway.</p>
