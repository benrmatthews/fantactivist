<h2>What is Fantastic Activist?</h2>
<p>Fantastic Activist is a place where the leading activists and founders of social movements can share their stories transparently, and where activists can come to read and learn from those examples. It's also a community where aspiring activists can come together to share their experiences, give and receive feedback, and rely on one another for support.</p>

<h2>What it's in it for me?</h2>
<p>Free traffic and marketing (useful for finding new supporters and partners); feedback opportunities from the people who read your interview; a unique and cathartic chance to share your knowledge and experiences with the world; and the warm feeling that comes from knowing your story will help others like you.</p>

<h2>Can you interview me or my cause?</h2>
<p>While some causes might be too early in their campaigns to have generated quanitifable social impact, doing a Fantastic Activist interview can be a great way to get the word out about your cause and recruit more supporters. If you want to take part, just head to <a href="/submit">the submission page</a> and read the guidelines. Feel free to point others there as well.

<h2>What's the best way to contact you?</h2>
<p>If you're looking for help, feedback, or guidance with something personal, I encourage you to post in the <a href="http://community.fantasticactivist.com">Fantastic Activist community</a> instead of contacting me. You'll get lots of great replies people in the community. If you ignore this and email me instead, I may well direct you to the <a href="http://community.fantasticactivist.com">Fantastic Activist community</a> anyway. üòÅ</p>
