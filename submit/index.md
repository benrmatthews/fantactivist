<h3>How do you get started?</h3>
<p>Just <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/montfort.io/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdmLSF9un-r704IIjQeWP7VPg4pcdiPkWXdP5klxgYBQ7nAmg/viewform">fill out this form</a> for your cause or social movement, and I'll get back to you (over email) with a standard set of interview questions for you to answer. 👍</p>
  
<h3>Who is eligible to be interviewed?</h3>
<p>Anyone who has started a cause or social movement that has generated some social impact. If your cause hasn't launched yet, or if it launched within the past couple of months, then it's probably too early for an interview. If in doubt, please get in touch anyway.</p>

<h3>Can my interview be anonymous?</h3>
<p>We understand that some people may be working with sensitive issues and may not want to become a potential target. As such, we respect your right to remain anonymous.</p>

<p>We only ask for an email address so we can contact you about your interview, but will treat all contact sensitively.</p>
   
<p>We'll also run your interview back past you before publishing on the site.</p>
